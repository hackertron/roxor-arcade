One of the hardest challenges when presenting training is to provide opportunities for students to continue
to interact with the material.

This is especially true when one training may build upon another,
but they are separated by some amount of time.
The probability of the student forgetting the training increases dramatically over time,
unless they can continue interacting with the material.

To provide more opportunities for students to reinforce their learning,
we have created a code repository to store training games.
Anyone can submit ideas for games on the wiki,
and additional code contributors to new and existing projects are always highly appreciated.
